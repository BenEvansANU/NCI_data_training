How to Use Data 
=================

This NCI Data Training site provides a number of examples that help you learn how to use, process and analyse data. 

In order to run the examples, you need to install Jupyter and Python on either your local machine and/or VDI. See instruction `here (local) <../_notebook/prep/install_jupyter.rst>`_ and `here (VDI) <../_notebook/prep/python_on_vdi.rst>`_.

You should be able to run examples at JupyterHub when it is available in the next few months, please stay tuned for that new service coming. 

You can find a list of examples grouped by theme:

* `Climate and Enviornment <../_notebook/climate/climate.rst>`_
* `Earth Observation <../_notebook/eo/eo.rst>`_
* `Geophysics <../_notebook/geophysics/geophysics.rst>`_

Or by service type:

* `THREDDS <../_notebook/tds/tds.rst>`_
* `GSKY <../_notebook/gsky/gsky.rst>`_
