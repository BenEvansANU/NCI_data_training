    "**Pangeo** is a community platform for big data in geoscience, funded by US NSF. Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software and computing infrastructure. The Pangeo software ecosystem involves open source tools such as xarray, iris, dask, jupyter, and many other packages. [This site](http://pangeo.io) provides guidance for accessing data and performing analysis using these tools. NCI has installed the Pangeo environment on Raijin by following instructions [here](http://pangeo.io/setup_guides/hpc.html). Please note that Pangeo will be transferred to Gadi when major Raijin/Gadi transition happens in Nov/Dec. It will not be available on Raijin from transition period onwards. This notebook provides instructions on how to use the Pangeo environment to run your jupyter notebook locally and interact with Raijin remotely on Raijin. "
