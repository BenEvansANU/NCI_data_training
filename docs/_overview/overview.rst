Overview
=============

The NCI National Reference Data Collections is Australia’s largest collection of research data, encompassing more than 10 PB of nationally and internationally significant datasets. They are available for use on  NCI’s platforms and also tuned for new high-performance data and informatics technologies. NCI has a team of expert data managers who can work with you to curate your data collection for optimal accessibility, analysis and data sharing.

NCI Data Training homepage provides a series of data access and analysis tutorials and jupyter notebook examples, as well as training workshop information.

Introduction
-------------

The NCI National Research Data Collection is Australia’s largest collection of research climate, weather, Earth systems, environmental, satellite, and geophysics research datasets.  NCI also has many other specialised domain datasets, such as optical astronomy and genomic data. This data is a mix of nationally generated datasets as well as replicated international datasets that need to be hosted at NCI.

There are currently more than 10 PB of nationally and internationally significant datasets that are managed at NCI, and with ongoing growth in many of these collections.  As well as data being available more generally, one of the important aspects about this data is that it is organised next to high performance computing and data analysis systems.

Most of the datasets are have been prioritised through the NCI collaboration, particularly in the priority science domains and with NCI partners (ANU, Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, GeoScience Australia) and ARC Centres of Excellence. The NCI data collections were primarily funded through a program under the NCRIS Research Data Service (RDS) (2013-7) and subsequently maintained with funding from the Australian Reserch Data Cloud (ARDC). In some cases the datasets have been augmented with a mix of NCI, research collaboration, partner, organisational and ARC funding.

NCI supports a number of key internationally recognised data principles:

* FAIR data principles for its major data collections. FAIR is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.
* Programmable and high performance access
* Open as possible, Closed as necessary
* Use Data Standards where-ever possible
* Transdisciplinary access
